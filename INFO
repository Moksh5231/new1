Problem Statement and Solution Elevator Pitch
Problem Statement:
The current testing process in Aetna's software development lifecycle is inefficient, heavily reliant on manual testing, and lacks a unified framework for both unit and behavior-driven testing. This leads to delayed releases, increased costs, and a higher likelihood of defects. Additionally, the absence of a centralized platform for code and test management hampers collaboration between developers and testers.

Solution Elevator Pitch:
We propose implementing JUnit for unit testing and Serenity BDD for behavior-driven testing, integrated with a GitHub Pilot program. This solution will automate testing processes, improve collaboration, and ensure faster, more reliable software releases. By leveraging GitHub as a centralized platform, we can streamline code management, testing, and reporting, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing time-to-market.

Proposed Solution
Solution Overview:
The solution involves:

JUnit Framework: For unit testing to ensure individual components of the application work as expected.

Serenity BDD Framework: For behavior-driven testing to validate end-to-end functionality and ensure alignment with business requirements.

GitHub Pilot: To centralize code repositories, automate CI/CD pipelines, and enable seamless collaboration between developers and testers.

Technologies Required:

JUnit 5

Serenity BDD

GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Power BI for test reporting and analytics

Assumptions
The existing codebase is compatible with JUnit and Serenity BDD frameworks.

Developers and testers have access to GitHub and are familiar with its features.

Power BI will be used for generating test reports and dashboards.

APIs for integrating GitHub with existing Aetna systems are available.

Constraints or Unmet Needs
Constraints:

Learning Curve: Teams may need training to adopt JUnit and Serenity BDD.

Integration Challenges: Integrating GitHub with existing Aetna systems may require additional development effort.

How They Are Addressed:

Provide comprehensive training sessions for developers and testers.

Allocate dedicated resources for GitHub integration and customization.

Benefits
Implementation of this solution will:

Save Time: Automate testing processes, reducing manual effort.

Simplify Development: Unified testing frameworks improve code quality and maintainability.

Increase Speed of Testing: Faster execution of unit and BDD tests.

Bring Competitive Value: Faster releases and higher-quality software.

Simplify Consumer Interaction: Fewer bugs and faster issue resolution.

Reduce Cost: Lower testing costs through automation.

Increase Engagement: Improved collaboration between developers and testers.

Next Steps
Conduct a pilot project to implement JUnit and Serenity BDD for a small module.

Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

Train developers and testers on the new frameworks and tools.

Monitor the pilot project's success and gather feedback.

Scale the solution across all Aetna development teams.
